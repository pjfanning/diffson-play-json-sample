# diffson-play-json-sample

A quick sample demonstrating the use of [Diffson](https://github.com/gnieh/diffson) 4.0.0-M4 with Play-JSON.

The upcoming Diffson release requires Play-JSON 2.8. https://github.com/pjfanning/diffson-play-json-sample/tree/play-json-2.7.4 gets Diffson 4.0.x to work with Play-JSON 2.7.4 by inlining the diffson-play-json-code.
